    <p>A stack can be used to check whether an arithmetic expression such as
    </p>

    <pre>3*(4+(5-6))/7</pre>

    <p>has properly balanced parentheses. Break the expression into its
    individual parts. </p>

    <pre>3 * ( 4 + ( 5 - 6 ) ) / 7</pre>

    <p>Push each part on a stack as it is encountered. When a <tt>)</tt> is
    encountered, pop everything until the matching <tt>(</tt>. If the stack is
    prematurely empty, then report an error.</p>

    <p>At the end, there should be no parentheses left. Otherwise, report an
        error.</p>
