Checker
=======

It depends, unfortunately. They won't get 4/6, but they might get 4 (without a denominator) if code-check can't figure out what the total was because it died prematurely.

It would be a good idea to have it figure out the total, perhaps by grading the solution. I'll add that to the wish list.

Shorten timeout, user selectable

When looking for the main class, it currently looks for the string 

public static void main(String[] args)

It will miss

public static void main (String[] args)

Instead, compile the solution and use reflection.

This might be done once when the problem is first submitted. The other metadata worth saving is the total number of points.

The issue I am currently running into with the system:
> I am providing a check.properties file, with 4 different args settings:
> test1.args-inputFile1.txt
> test2.args-too many arguments
> test3.args-
> test4.args-thisFileNameIsMissingSoItCannotBeFound.txt

That's a reasonable expectation. But to make it true, you need to add 

test1.in-
test2.in-
test3.in-
test4.in-

to check.properties or supply four blank files test1.in ... test4.in. Right now, it doesn't look at testn.args if there isn't a testn.in or testn.out.

Are we running as root in aws? How to change?
